The strategies are informed by industry insights and tailored to your experience with major players in the air ticketing industry.

## Part 1: Speeding Up TTN.global's Decision to Collaborate

### Background

TTN.global is a leading B2C travel platform offering flight tickets, accommodations, and other travel services (TTN.global). Your year-long negotiation suggests potential delays due to internal processes, competing proposals, or unresolved concerns. The following steps aim to address these barriers and expedite the collaboration.

### Strategies

#### 1. Demonstrate Value with Data:

Compile a proposal highlighting the business you can bring to TTN.global. Include:
- **Audience Reach**: Number of potential customers you can reach through your channels.
- **Sales Projections**: Estimated ticket sales based on historical data or market analysis.
- **Competitive Advantage**: How your partnership can help TTN.global compete in a market with rising travel costs (e.g., 2.6% increase in flight prices in 2019, per CWT Tips).

*Example*: If you have sold 1,000 tickets annually through other platforms, project similar or higher sales with TTN.global's broader portfolio.

#### 2. Address Potential Concerns:

Identify and resolve any hesitations TTN.global may have, such as:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Offer performance-based terms (e.g., commission only after a sales threshold).
- **References**: Provide testimonials or case studies from other airline or travel partners.

Schedule a meeting to discuss concerns directly, ensuring open communication (Direct Travel Tips).

#### 3. Propose a Pilot Program:

Suggest a low-risk pilot project, such as selling a limited number of tickets for a specific route or season. This allows TTN.global to test the partnership without a full commitment.

*Example*: A 3-month pilot targeting 500 ticket sales with performance metrics to evaluate success.

#### 4. Leverage Your Network:

Highlight your connections with other airlines and travel websites. Emphasize how these relationships can drive cross-promotions or bundled offers, increasing TTN.global's market share.

*Example*: If you're affiliated with Expedia, mention potential co-marketing opportunities.

#### 5. Set Clear Deadlines:

Politely inquire about TTN.global's decision timeline. Express enthusiasm for the partnership while noting other opportunities you're exploring to create a sense of urgency.

## Part 2: Building a Network for Exclusive Offers

### Background

Building a network with airlines and travel websites offering exclusive deals through affiliate programs can diversify your revenue streams and strengthen your position in negotiations with TTN.global.

If you lack a website, consider creating one using platforms like WordPress to showcase travel content.
